# Register Resize Callback

## Use case

A wrapper that registers a callback to be called when a node is resized.

## How to install

```bash
  yarn add @bedrock-layout/register-resize-callback
```

## init

Before you can use the `register-resize-callback` package, you need to initialize it. This is done by calling the `init` function. The `init` function will initialize the ResizeObserver so it is important that this function is only run in the browser. It can, however, be called multiple times without any harm.

For example, if you want to use the `register-resize-callback` package in a React application, you can call `init` in the `useEffect` function, like this:

```js
import { init } from "@bedrock-layout/register-resize-callback";

useEffect(() => {
  init();
}, []);
```

## Basic usage

After you have initialized the `register-resize-callback` you can use the `registerCallback` function to register a callback. The `registerCallback` function takes a callback function and a node as arguments. The callback function will be called when the node is resized. The callback can be in the form of a function that accepts a `ResizeObserverEntry` as an argument or it can be an object with a `current` property that is a function that accepts a `ResizeObserverEntry` as an argument.

The `registerCallback` function returns a function that can be used to unregister the callback.

```javascript
import { registerCallback } from "@bedrock-layout/register-resize-callback";

const callback = (entry) => {
  console.log(entry);
};

const callbackObj = {
  current: (entry) => {
    console.log(entry);
  },
};

const header = document.querySelector("header");

const article = document.querySelector("article");

//register a callback for a node
const cleanupHeader = registerCallback(header, callback);

const cleanupArticle = registerCallback(article, callbackObj);

callbackObj.current = (entry) => {
  console.log("new callback", entry);
};

//unregister the callback
cleanupHeader();
cleanupArticle();
```
