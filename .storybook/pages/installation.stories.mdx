## Getting Started

Lets start by creating our boilerplate React application

```bash
yarn create react-app bedrock-layouts
cd bedrock-layouts
```

Bedrock Layouts is built on top of it's own css framework, `@bedrock-layout/css`. We need to install this as a dependency.

Before you install any of the Bedrock Layout Primitives, you will need to install `@bedrock-layout/css` first. Let's start out by installing our the `Stack` component:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/css @bedrock-layout/stack
```

Now that we have our dependencies installed, let's import the `@bedrock-layout/css` into our `index.js` file:

```jsx
import from '@bedrock-layout/css'
```

If you would prefer to only import the css of the components you are using, you can import the css from the individual components:

```jsx
import '@bedrock-layout/css/lib/components/stack.min.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/css/lib/components/center.min.css';
```

## App.js

Now that we have our dependencies installed, let's import the `Stack` component into our `App.js` file:

Replace the code in App.js with the following example:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter='size3'>
      <header>
        <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
      </header>
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Finally, let's start the development server by running `yarn start`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and you should see the following output:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 500 }}
    src={initialSetup}
    alt="initial setup of landing page for Coco le Belle"
  />
</Center>

We are now ready to start building our layout. In the next section, we will learn how to use the `Stack` component to create our first component in our landing page.

<Inline switchAt="25rem" stretch={1} gutter="size3" minItemWidth="fit-content">
  <Button as="a" href="/?path=/docs/getting-started-introduction--page">
    Introduction
  </Button>
  <span />
  <Button
    as="a"
    href="/?path=/docs/getting-started-lesson-2-your-first-component--page"
  >
    Your First Component
  </Button>
</Inline>
