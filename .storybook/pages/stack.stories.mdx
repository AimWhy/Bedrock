# Your First Component

One of the simplest and yet most common layout patterns found on the web is putting one element on top of another element with consistent space between the elements. This problem is precisely what the [**Stack**](http://localhost:9001/?path=/docs/spacer-components-stack) primitive solves.

Let's take the following component design mock up as an example:

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "60ch" }}
  src={newsletter}
  alt="Design mock of a subscribe to our newsletter component with each element stacked on top of the other"
/>

In the above design we have headings, paragraphs, labels, input fields, and buttons. Though the all have their own visual styles, they are all laid out in a consistent way: stacked on top of each other with a consistent space between them.

## Subscribing to our newsletter

Let's start by creating a new file called `Subscribe.js` and add the following code:

(In this tutorial, we will not be adding any styles to our components so as to keep things simple)

```jsx
export function Subscribe() {
  return (
    <form>
      <div>
        <h2>Subscribe To Our Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
          Subscribe to our newsletter to keep up to date on all our amazing
          products.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          Name
          <input type="text" />
        </label>

        <label>
          Email
          <input type="email" />
        </label>

        <button>Subscribe</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}
```

We can now import our new Subscribe component into our `App.js` file:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter="md">
      <header>
        <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
      </header>
      <Subscribe />
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "60ch" }}
  src={newsletterBefore}
  alt="Subscribe to newletter component before adding the Stack"
/>

## Adding the Stack

Now, we simply use the `Stack` primitive to lay out the elements according to the mockup:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";

export function Subscribe() {
  return (
    <Stack as='form' gutter='xl'>
      <Stack gutter='md'>
        <h2>Subscribe To Our Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
          Subscribe to our newsletter to keep up to date on all our amazing
          products.
        </p>
      </Stack>

      <Stack gutter='lg'>
        <Stack as='label' gutter='sm'>
          Name
          <input type="text" />
        </Stack>

        <Stack as='label' gutter='sm'>
          Email
          <input type="email" />
        </Stack>

        <button>Subscribe</button>
      </Stack>
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

And now your browser should show the following:

Your browser should now show the following:

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "60ch" }}
  src={newsletterAfter}
  alt="Subscribe to newletter component after adding the Stack"
/>

In the above `Subscribe` component, we are taking advantage of two import parts of Bedrock Layout Primitives. The first is that all Bedrock Layout Primitives expose the polymorphic `as` prop. This prop allows us to control exactly which element is rendered on to our page. We have used the `Stack` as a `form` element, which is a container for the all the elements. We have also used the `Stack` primitive as a `label` element, to stack the input label text above its corresponding input field.

The other part of the Stack primitive is the `gutter` prop. This allows you to control the space between the elements. Bedrock Layout Primitives has implemented a default spacing scheme, but this can be adjusted to fit any style guide. In the next section we will learn more about Bedrock Layout Primitives spacing scheme and how to override it with our own.

<Inline switchAt="25rem" stretch={1} gutter="md" minItemWidth="fit-content">
  <Button
    as="a"
    href="/?path=/docs/getting-started-lesson-1-installation--page"
  >
    Installation
  </Button>
  <span />
  <Button as="a" href="/?path=/docs/getting-started-lesson-3-spacing--page">
    Spacing
  </Button>
</Inline>
