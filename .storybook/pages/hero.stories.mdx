# The Hero

A common landing page feature is the "Hero" layout. A Hero tends to be the first thing a user sees on a page, and is usually the most important thing to focus on. It is usually a large image and/or heading, with a short description of the page, and a call to action.

The Hero layout is easily achieved using the [`Cover`](/?path=/docs/components-cover--api) component.

## Building a Hero

Let's start by stubbing out the markup we'll need. In our `App.js` file, we'll change it to add the following:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter="md">
      <Menu />
      <Stack as="header" gutter="lg">
        <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
        <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
        <Inline gutter="md">
          <button>New Arrivals</button>
        </Inline>
      </Stack>
      <Subscribe />
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={heroPageInitial}
    alt="The landing page before the hero layout styles have been applied."
  />
</Center>

The Cover component is a wrapper component that will vertically center the content. It also let's you optionally render an item on above and/or below the content.

So let's start by downloading the Cover component:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/cover
```

And then we'll add the following to our `App.js` file:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";
import { Cover } from "@bedrock-layout/cover";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter="md">
      <Cover minHeight="50vh" gutter="md" top={<Menu />}>
        <Stack as="header" gutter="lg">
          <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
          <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
          <Inline gutter="md">
            <button>New Arrivals</button>
          </Inline>
        </Stack>
      </Cover>
      <Subscribe />
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={heroPageWithCover}
    alt="The landing page with the hero layout styles have been applied."
  />
</Center>

## Adding the Center component

Our layout could use some additional styling. Let's add the [`Center`](/?path=/docs/components-center--api) component to our `App.js` file. First, we need to install it:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/center
```

Then we can add it to our `App.js` file:

```jsx
import { Stack } from "@bedrock-layout/stack";
import { Inline } from "@bedrock-layout/inline";
import { Cover } from "@bedrock-layout/cover";
import { Center } from "@bedrock-layout/center";

import { Subscribe } from "./Subscribe";
import { Menu } from "./Menu";

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gutter="md">
      <Cover minHeight="50vh" gutter="md" top={<Menu />}>
        <Center maxWidth="40rem">
          <Stack as="header" gutter="lg">
            <h1>Coco Le Belle</h1>
            <p>Elegant Feminine Fashion</p>
            <Inline gutter="md">
              <button>New Arrivals</button>
            </Inline>
          </Stack>
        </Center>
      </Cover>
      <Center centerText>
        <Subscribe />
      </Center>
    </Stack>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your browser should now show the following:

<Center centerChildren>
  <img
    style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
    src={heroPageWithCenter}
    alt="The landing page with the hero layout and center styles have been applied."
  />
</Center>

## AppBoundary

When we think of responsive design, we typically think of phones and tablets. However, screen resolutions are getting larger and larger and allowing a page to grow to the same width as a 4K monitor is irresponsible. A website typically should clamp at an outer limit and stay centered on the screen.

The `AppBoundary` is built on the `Center` component and is designed to wrap your entire app. By default, it will clamp the width at the 1920px, the `xxlarge` size option, but can be set to any of the valid size options.

Let's start by installing the AppBoundary:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/appboundary
```

Then we can update our `index.js` file to use the AppBoundary:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import { AppBoundary } from "@bedrock-layout/appboundary";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AppBoundary boundarySize="xlarge">
      <App />
    </AppBoundary>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

Now the AppBoundary will clamp the width of your app to the `xlarge` size option, or 1439px.

Our landing page is coming along. In the next section, we'll be building cards and add them to a responsive grid layout.

<Inline switchAt="25rem" stretch={1} gutter="md">
  <Button as="a" href="/?path=/docs/the-menu-component--page">
    The Menu Component
  </Button>
  <span />
  <Button disabled>The New Arrivals</Button>
</Inline>
