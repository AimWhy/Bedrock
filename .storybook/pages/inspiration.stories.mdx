# Inspiration

We are now in the age of components where we build self-contained parts of our application in isolation and then wire them up later in various parts of our app.
For this reason, [adding margin to our components is considered harmful.](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin)
There is a significant need to abstract layout into its own component in this age of components, using React's powerful composition pattern to layout our components for us easily and consistently.

## Motivation for writing Bedrock Layout Primitives

I have worked on two internal-only design systems. Neither one of them was permitted to be made open source.
Ultimately, I decided to build this library to take advantage of the things I have learned about building Layout components so I can reuse them in my projects.

## Prior Art

As I mentioned before, I have worked on two internal design systems, but I would have to say the resource that has inspired me the most has got to be [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).
This resource is fantastic and worth the money for the time and energy they have spent making it.
