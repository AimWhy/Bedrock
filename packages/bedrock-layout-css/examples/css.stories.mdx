# CSS Only

**EXPERIMENTAL**

I am currently working on a CSS-only version of this library. More details will be added soon.

## How to install

`npm install @bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css`

## How to import

You can import all the entire CSS bundle like this:

```javascript
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/bedrock-layout.css';
```

Or you can import just the parts you want from the components directory

```javascript
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/spacing-properties.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/reset.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/stack.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/center.css';
```

In lieu of the above, you can also use the `<link>` tag with it's source set to the UNPKG version:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/bedrock-layout.css"
/>
```

or

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/stack.css"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/center.css"
/>
```

Please note that the CSS is not minified at this time.

## Not included

There are a few components/APIs that are not included in the pure CSS version. These are:

- `MasonryGrid`
- `PadBox`
- `AppBoundary`
- The `switchAt` API for `Split` and `Columns`

They are left out either because they require additional JavaScript to work or the developer experience is lost in the CSS-only version.
