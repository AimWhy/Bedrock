# A CSS only version of Bedrock Layout Primitives

This CSS only version of Bedrock Layout Primitives makes it easy to use Bedrock Layout Primitives in any app, no matter your frontend stack.

It's highly influenced by the [AVO method of CSS](https://chan.dev/avo) made famous by Michael Chan (Chantastic).

## How to install

`yarn add @bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css`

## How to import

You can import the entire CSS bundle like this:

```javascript
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/bedrock-layout.min.css';
```

Or you can import just the parts you want from the components directory

```javascript
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/spacing-properties.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/reset.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/stack.css';
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/center.css';
```

In lieu of the above, you can also use the `<link>` tag with it's source set to the UNPKG version:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/"
/>
```

or

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/stack.css"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/center.css"
/>
```

Currently, only the main bundled CSS file is available in a minified format:

```javascript
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/bedrock-layout.min.css';
```

## Not included

There are a few components/APIs that are not included in the pure CSS version. These are:

- `MasonryGrid`
- `PadBox`
- `AppBoundary`
- The `switchAt` API for `Split` and `Columns`

They are left out either because they require additional JavaScript to work or the developer experience is lost in the CSS-only version.
