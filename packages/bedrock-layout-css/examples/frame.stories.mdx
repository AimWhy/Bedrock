# frame.css

This is a CSS Only version of the [Frame package](/?path=/docs/components-frame--api).

## Use case

The Frame is useful for cropping content, typically media, to a desired aspect ratio. The frame is designed to be a wrapper that crops the children of an element to the size of the element, while maintaining the content's aspect ratio.

The frame does not have an intrinsic size and can either be sized by the parent element, directly using class or inline styles, or by setting the `--ratio` value in the inline style.

## Usage

First you need to import the appropriate stylesheet. The frame is part of the main CSS bundle or you can import it in individually from the components directory.

```javascript
import '@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/bedrock-layout.css';

// or

import "@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css/lib/components/frame.css";
```

Then you add the `data-bedrock-frame` attribute to the desired element.

## --ratio

The `--ratio` prop takes a an ratio as a fraction, which prepresent the ratio of width to height of the desired aspect ratio.

In the example below, the frame will maintain a 4:3 aspect ratio and will crop the image to fit.

<Canvas withToolbar withSource="open">
  <Story name="--ratio">
    <div data-bedrock-frame style={{ "--ratio": "4/3" }}>
      <img src={imgSrc} alt="computer with data" />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## --position

By default, the media will be centered in the frame, but you can specify the position of the media by passing in a `--position` prop. The `--position` prop takes [any valid object-position value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) as a string.

In the example below, the frame will maintain a 4:3 aspect ratio and will crop the image to fit, but the image will be positioned at the top-left of the frame.

<Canvas withToolbar withSource="open">
  <Story name="--position">
    <div
      data-bedrock-frame
      style={{ "--position": "left top", "--ratio": "4/3" }}
    >
      <img src={imgSrc} alt="computer with data" />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Without an Aspect Ratio

You can also use the Frame without a ratio. This will allow you to specify the width and height of the frame, while still taking advantage of the cropping functionality.

In the example below, the frame's height is set to `50vh` and its width is set to `50%`. The image will be cropped to fit the frame.

<Canvas withToolbar withSource="open">
  <Story name="no ratio">
    <div data-bedrock-frame style={{ height: "50vh", width: "50%" }}>
      <img src={imgSrc} alt="computer with data" />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
