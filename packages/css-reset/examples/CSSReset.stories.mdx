# CSS Reset

A CSS Reset that compliments well with the Bedrock Layout Primitives

## Another CSS Reset

I know there are several CSS Resets out there, and one might ask why another one.
This reset has been curated from a few resources and has become my default reset for any project I do now.
Though this reset is not required for Bedrock Layout Primitives, it does complement it nicely, and I would highly recommend it.

## How to install

To get the full benefit, you use the [focus-visible polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/focus-visible).
It's most easily used by installing from npm:

```bash
npm install focus-visible

# or

yarn add focus-visible
```

Then install the reset from npm:

```bash
yarn add @bedrock-layout/center
```

If you plan on using the `GlobalStyle` component or the mixin, then you will need to install `styled-components`:

## Basic usage

### CSS Mixin

The reset [mixin](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#css) is best used at the beginning of your global style

```javascript
import { reset } from "@bedrock-layout/css-reset";

const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
  ${reset}
`;
```

### GlobalStyle

[The `GlobalStyle` component](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#createglobalstyle) is used when you don't have your own global styles to use

```javascript
import { GlobalStyles } from "@bedrock-layout/css-reset";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <GlobalStyles />
      {/* The rest of the component */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### CSS Stylesheet

You can also just bring in the CSS Stylesheet directly from the `@bedrock-layout/bedrock-layout-css` package. Check out the [CSS Stylesheet docs](/docs/css-only-reset-css--page) for more information.
